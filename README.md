# Stratogi

## Overview

Welcome to Stratogi, a work-in-progress app that aims to revolutionize your gaming experience by combining strategic games like chess, shogi, and go into a single, user-friendly platform. My vision is to create an app that not only teaches people how to play these classic strategic games but also introduces them to similar games they might not be familiar with.
